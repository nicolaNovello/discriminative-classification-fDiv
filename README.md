Official repository of the paper "$f$-Divergence Based Classification: Beyond the Use of Cross-Entropy " published at ICML 2024. 

> Novel class of objective functions for supervised classification problems, based on the $f$-divergence. We estimate the posterior probability (continuous or discrete) and maximize it to solve classification tasks.

# üíª How to run the code

For the image classification tasks, the file `main.py` runs the experiments. The code runs iterating over multiple random seeds, network architectures and objective functions. They can be set by modifying the lists: 
```
list_cost_func_v = [5] 
random_seeds = [0]
net_architectures = ["ResNet18"] 
dataset_type = "cifar10"
```
where the IDs of the objective functions are:
- 2: GAN
- 3: CE
- 5: SL
- 7: KL with softplus as last activation function
- 9: RKL
- 10: HD
- 12: P
  
while the available network architectures are:
- ResNet18
- PreActResNet18
- MobileNetV2
- VGG
- SimpleDLA
- DenseNet121


For the decoding tasks, the file `main_communications.py` runs the experiments.
